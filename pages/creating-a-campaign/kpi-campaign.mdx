# Creating a campaign with a KPI

Creating a basic campaign on Metrom is straightforward, as covered in
[creating a campaign](/creating-a-campaign). Launching one with an attached KPI
is just as easy. For a quick refresher on KPIs, check out
[KPI based liquidity mining](/kpi).

### Configuration

Once all the required form steps are completed, it's time to enable the KPI and
explore the available configuration options.

-   **Current TVL**: Represents the most recent total value locked in the
    selected pool, which is being incentivized.

-   **Lower and upper bounds**: These values allow you to customize the
    incentivization strategy by restricting reward distribution to a specific
    TVL range. For inspiration, check out the [KPI usecases](/kpi/usecases).

-   **Minimum payout**: This is the percentage of rewards that will be
    distributed to LPs, regardless of the KPI.

The KPI step also provides a simulation of your configuration, giving you an
overview of how the rewards distribution will change as the TVL fluctuates.
Let's say we want to have a linear incentivization between `$0` and a target of
up to `$100k`.

Once you're satisfied with the KPI setup, apply the changes and head to the
campaign preview, where you can review all the details, including the KPI
configuration and simulation.

At this point, the only thing left to do is launch the campaign.
