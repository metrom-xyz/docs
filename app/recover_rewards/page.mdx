## Rewards recovery

The rewards recovery mechanism allows campaign owners to reclaim any unspent or reimbursable rewards after a campaign ends or when certain KPI conditions are not fully met.

### 1. Viewing recovery status

#### Access the Claims Dashboard
Campaign owners log in to Metrom and navigate to the claim section.

<div className="mediaWrapper">

</div>

#### Recovery overview
The dashboard lists each reward token with the available recovery amount and provides:
- An individual **Recover** button next to each token.
- A **Recover all** option to claim all unspent rewards in a single transaction.

### 2. Initiating recovery

#### Select recovery option

- **Recover**

For recovering a specific tokenâ€™s unspent rewards, click the **Recover** button adjacent to that token.

- **Recover all**

To reclaim all available unspent rewards across multiple tokens, click the **Recover all** button.

## 3. Confirming the  transaction

#### Wallet transaction prompt
Once a recovery option is selected, the connected wallet (e.g., MetaMask) will open a transaction confirmation prompt.

#### Review transaction details
The wallet displays:
- The token amount(s) to be recovered.
- Associated network fees.

#### Sign and submit
After verifying the details, sign the transaction to authorize the recovery.

### 4. Confirmation and post-claim actions

#### On-screen confirmation
A confirmation message is displayed on the platform, notifying the user that the unspent rewards have been successfully recovered.

#### Wallet update
Users can check their wallet to verify that the reward tokens have been deposited.
