## Creating a campaign with Range Based Incentive

Creating a basic campaign on Metrom is straightforward, as covered in
[creating a campaign](/creating-a-campaign). Launching one with an attached
Range-based Incentive is just as easy. For a quick refresher on Range-based
Incentives, check out [Range Based Incentives](/rbi).

### Configuration

Once all the required form steps are completed, it's time to enable the **SET
RANGE TO REWARD** and explore the available configuration options.

Once enabled, the interface shows a range visualizer with the current price
displayed at the top.

- **Current Price**: Shows you the current price for the tokens that are present
  in the selected pool. You can toggle the relative price in terms of Token A /
  Token B by clicking on the token name.

- **Min Price & Max Price**: These values allow you to customize the
  incentivization strategy by restricting reward distribution to a specific tick
  range.

- **Range Visualizer**: It lets you visualize the range you set for
  incentivization. The middle is always the current price of the tokens.

**Example Campaign**:

In the **USDC-USDT pair**, the **current price is 1 USDC = 1.0002 USDT**. If you
click on USDT, it will show the current price of 1 USDT = 0.9995 USDC.

**Min Price we set is 0.99** and the set **Max price to 1.01**.

Range visualizer will show you the range you set to incentivize in real-time.

Once youâ€™re satisfied with the Range-based incentivization setup, apply the
changes and head to the campaign preview, where you can review all the details,
including the configuration and simulation.

At this point, the only thing left to do is launch the campaign.
