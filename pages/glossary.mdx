## Glossary

A basic package of all definitions related to Metrom.

-   **Concentrated liquidity**: Liquidity allocated within a custom price range.
    With the concentrated liquidity mechanics, LPs can accumulate their capital
    to smaller price intervals than (0, ∞) enabling individualized price curves,
    higher capital efficiency & deeper liquidity for traders.

-   **Campaigns**: Allow projects and AMMs to incentivize and attract liquidity
    providers.

-   **Incentives / rewards**: Tokens offered by campaign creators in exchange
    for providing liquidity. Incentives encourage engagement and participation.

-   **KPI (key performance indicator)**: Measurable value that demonstrates how
    effectively a protocol is achieving its objectives. In the context of
    Metrom, KPIs are metrics tied to the success of liquidity campaigns, helping
    to determine whether the liquidity pools have met specific targets to unlock
    rewards.

-   **Liquidity density**: Calculated measure that reflects both the size of a
    liquidity pool and the concentration of liquidity in specific price ranges.
    It assesses how much liquidity is available and how tightly it is
    positioned, indicating the market’s ability to handle trades efficiently
    with minimal price impact.
