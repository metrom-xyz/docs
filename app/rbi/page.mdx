## Range Based Incentives

Range-Based Incentives introduce a targeted approach to incentivizing liquidity
in AMMs, especially those using concentrated liquidity models.

Instead of distributing rewards evenly across all liquidity providers, these
incentives focus emissions on LPs supplying liquidity within targeted tick
ranges, aligning rewards with areas where liquidity is most needed.

The traditional approach to distributing incentives targets all in-range
positions. Introducing range-based incentives will allow the creation of
campaigns that focus on specific price ranges or bands.

For example, in a DAI/USDC pool, a narrow range (0.995 – 1.005) could be
incentivized to concentrate liquidity where it’s most needed.

This approach maximizes liquidity depth in critical zones, reduces slippage, and
improves capital efficiency.
