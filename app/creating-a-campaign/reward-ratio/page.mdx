# Add Reward Ratio


Precision‑tune how incentives flow to liquidity providers—no custom contracts required.

### What is Reward Ratio?
Reward Ratio is an optional toggle in the Metrom campaign builder that lets you split emissions across **Token A**, **Token B**, and **Fees generated** instead of paying every position the same flat APR.


### How it works under the hood

You're not locked into a 50/50 split. Pick exactly which behaviour you want to incentivise by assigning a ratio to three separate inputs:

- **Token A** – rewards LPs for providing depth on the first asset

- **Token B** – rewards LPs for providing depth on the second asset

- **Fees** – rewards positions that are earning (i.e., in‑range, concentrated liquidity)

**Example:**

- A ratio of **Token A** - 0.3 | **Token B** - 0.3 | **Fees** - 0.4 means:

- 30 % of each epoch's rewards are distributed based on the amount of Token A in the position

- 30 % based on Token B

- 40 % based on fees earned

> **Note:** Reward Ratio only distributes to active, in‑range liquidity—out‑of‑range TVL earns nothing. Metrom automatically normalises ratios if they don't add up to exactly 1.



### Enabling Reward Ratio

![Reward Ratio Setup](/videos/reward-ratio-setup.gif)

1. **Create** a campaign → **Rewards tab**.
2. Toggle **Reward Ratio**.
3. **Enter percentages that sum to 100 %**. 

Example:

 - "tokenA": 30,
 -  "tokenB": 30,
 -  "fees"  : 0.4

4. That's it—no further action needed. You can now proceed to enabling KPI or Range Based incentives or directly jump to the Campaign Preview. 

### FAQs

#### Do ratios have to total 100 %?
Yes. If they don't, the UI warns you and Metrom normalises them before committing on‑chain.

#### Does this work with Points campaigns?
Yes it does work with the Points campaign. 

#### What if my pool has custom tokens?
Reward Ratio is agnostic to token types; simply map the sides you want to incentivise.
