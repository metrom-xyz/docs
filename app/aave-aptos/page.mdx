# AAVE on Aptos liquidity incentives 

### Overview

Metrom powers the liquidity incentive campaign for AAVE's first non-EVM deployment on Aptos. Liquidity providers who supply stablecoins to AAVE markets on Aptos can earn additional $APT rewards on top of their base lending yields.

### Campaign details

- **Reward token**: $APT
- **Eligible assets**: USDC, USDT
- **Estimated APR**: ~8% on net-supply
- **Rewrd distribution frequency**: Every 24 hours
- **Campaign page**: [https://aptos.metrom.xyz](https://aptos.metrom.xyz/)

Your rewards are calculated based on your net-supply position.

**Net supply formula**:
```
Net Supply = Total supplied assets - borrowed assets
```

### Qualifying actions

To be eligible for $APT rewards, you must:

1. Supply USDC or USDT to AAVE on Aptos after campaign launch
