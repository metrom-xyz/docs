## Understanding Range Based Incentive campaigns

Range-Based Incentives enable campaign creators to direct liquidity rewards to
specific price ranges within AMM pools, optimizing liquidity placement where it
matters most.

## Technical Overview

### Key Components

#### Price Ranges (Tick Ranges):

- Liquidity is concentrated within discrete intervals (e.g., 0.99 – 1.005 for
  stablecoins).
- Defined using AMM-specific tick systems (e.g., Uniswap V3’s sqrtPrice ticks).

#### Liquidity Providers (LPs):

- Stake tokens in targeted ranges to earn rewards.
- Incentivized to optimize capital allocation (e.g., avoiding ranges with low
  trading activity).

#### Reward Allocation:

- Campaign creators distribute rewards proportionally to liquidity provision
  within specified ranges.
- Supports multiple reward tokens (e.g., protocol tokens, stablecoins).

### Tech behind calculation

Each active position in the pool's range is compared to the incentivized range
and its weight (i.e. liquidity contribution) is scaled proportional to the
intersecting range. There are 3 cases possible here:

**The position is completely off range**: Its weight is just nullified and the
position's owner is not given any reward for that position.

**The position is completely in range**: The position's weight is taken as-is,
depending on its liquidity density function (amount of tokens provided for the
picked concentration level).

**The position is partially in range**: The width of the intersection between
the position's range and the incentivized range is calculated and compared to
the width of the full incentivized range. The ratio of the 2 is used as a
multiplier to scale down the overall weight of the position.

These are examples for both cases, assuming we have an incentivized range going
from tick 0 to tick 10 for a pool:

- Assuming we have a **position with weight 100 that goes from tick 100 to tick
  110**, that won't be taken into consideration when giving out rewards.
- Assuming we have a **position with weight 100 that goes from tick 1 to tick
  5**, that will be taken in consideration with weight 100 (i.e. in full) when
  giving out rewards.
- Assuming we have a **position with weight 100 that goes from tick -10 to tick
  10**, we calculate the intersecting range's width, which in this case is 10,
  and compare it to the full position range (20) to find out that we need to
  consider 50% of the position's weight, so 50.

### Campaign workflow

1. **Define Ranges**: Campaign creators specify target price ranges (e.g., 0.99
   – 1.005 for stablecoin pools).

2. **LPs Deposit Liquidity**: LPs stake tokens in the defined ranges via AMM
   interfaces (e.g., Uniswap V3 positions).

3. **Reward Distribution**: Rewards are distributed based on LPs’ liquidity
   exposure within ranges. It can be claimed via Metrom’s dashboard.

### Comparison with traditional incentives

| METRIC                     | TRADITIONAL INCENTIVES     | RANGE BASED INCENTIVES                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Liquidity Distribution** | Uniform across all ranges  | <span className="greenText">Concentrated in critical zones</span> |
| **Capital Efficiency**     | Low (wasted rewards)       | <span className="greenText">High (reduced slippage)</span>        |
| **User Experience**        | Suboptimal (high slippage) | <span className="greenText">Improved (tighter spreads)</span>     |

### Core benefits

**Directed Liquidity**: Protocols can guide LPs on where their liquidity is most
valuable, aligning with strategic objectives.

**Increased Efficiency**: Deep liquidity in targeted ranges reduces slippage and
improves user satisfaction.

**Effective**: Protocols achieve greater liquidity for the same or even lower
incentive spend, maximizing ROI.

**Flexibility**: Suitable for stable, and yield-bearing pools, Range-Based
Incentives adapt to diverse use cases and goals.
