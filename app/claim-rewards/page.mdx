## Claiming rewards

The reward claiming process is designed to be straightforward, ensuring that
users can claim their accrued rewards with minimal effort. The following steps
describe the complete flow:

### 1. Initiating a reward claim

#### Access the claims dashboard

Navigate to the claims section of the platform (available on the top navigation
bar). Here, all available rewards are displayed. Each reward is listed with the
corresponding token and the total amount accrued.

#### Select your claim option

- **Claim reward:** For individual rewards, click the **Claim reward** button
  located next to the respective token.
- **Claim All:** If a user has accumulated rewards for multiple tokens, the
  **Claim all** option allows them to claim all available rewards in one
  transaction, saving time and reducing gas fees.

### 2. Confirming the transaction

#### Wallet prompt

After clicking the claim button (either **Claim Reward** or **Claim All**), the
user’s connected wallet (such as MetaMask or another supported wallet) will
automatically open a transaction prompt.

#### Review transaction details

The prompt will display the details of the transaction, including:

- The total number of tokens to be claimed.
- Associated network fees.
- Confirmation of the token types involved.

#### Sign and submit

Once the user verifies that all details are correct, they sign and submit the
transaction through their wallet.

#### Reward transfer

After a successful signature, the system automatically transfers the reward
tokens to the user’s wallet.

### 4. Confirmation and post-claim actions

#### On-screen confirmation

A confirmation message is displayed on the platform, notifying the user that the
rewards have been successfully claimed.

#### Wallet update

Users can check their wallet to verify that the reward tokens have been
deposited.
