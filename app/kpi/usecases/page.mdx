## KPI uses cases

_The following outlines how to design KPI incentive campaigns to more
effectively achieve your project goals and objectives. Feel free to contact the
team to discuss any of these use cases._

For a closer look at how KPI-based incentivization works and the benefits it
brings, check out our in-depth article
[here](https://medium.com/@metromxyz/kpi-based-farming-aligning-incentives-between-projects-and-communities-d2fd0ccc6ac1).
We break down how Metrom simplifies reward structures and optimizes distribution
through various KPI use cases.

### Quick reference glossary

- **KPI**: TVL goal that the project would like to reach.

- **Upper bound**: Upper limit value above which no more rewards are
  distributed.
- **Lower bound**: Lower limit value below which no rewards are distributed.

- **Minimum payout**: Amount of rewards paid out regardless of whether a KPI is
  met or not.

### Linear incentivization

**Scenario**: Target KPI of `$100k` total value locked (TVL), with `$10k`
allocated as rewards.

</div>

**Mechanism**: Rewards are distributed proportionally based on how much of the
KPI is achieved. If the pool reaches `60%` of the target (`$60k` in TVL), then
`$6k` (`60%` of the reward pool) is distributed to the liquidity providers.

**Takeaway**: Linear incentivization offers flexibility, allowing LPs to still
earn rewards even if the full KPI isn’t met.

### Minimum payout

**Scenario**: Target KPI of `$100k` total value locked (TVL), with `$10k`
allocated as rewards, and a minimum payout percentage of `80%`.

<div className="mediaWrapper">

</div>

**Mechanism**: `80%` of the rewards, so `$8k`, is distributed regardless of the
KPI outcome, while the remaining `20%` is unlocked only if the target KPI is
met. The remaining `20%` is unlocked and distributed proportionally with the KPI
target being met between `80–100%`, and not just if the `100k` TVL upper bound
is reached. If the pool reaches `$90k` in TVL, `$8k` is distributed as the
minimum payout, while the full `$10k` is only unlocked if the TVL reaches
`$100k`.

**Takeaway**: This structure guarantees a baseline reward, reducing the risk for
LPs and ensuring liquidity, even if the target is slightly missed.

### Bonus-driven incentives

**Scenario**: Target KPI of `$100k` total value locked (TVL), with `$10k`
allocated as rewards, where `$10k` is the minimum payout and an additional `$1k`
bonus distribution based on the KPI met.

<div className="mediaWrapper">

</div>

**Mechanism**: Rewards are distributed proportionally based on KPI achievement,
with the bonus activated if the target is exceeded. If the pool reaches `$100k+`
in TVL, LPs receive the full `$10k` plus an additional `$1k` as a bonus.

**Takeaway**: This structure encourages LPs to push beyond the target, rewarding
higher performance with extra incentives.

### Lower bound and upper bound

**Scenario**: Target KPI of `$100k` total value locked (TVL), with `$10k`
allocated as rewards, and a lower limit set at `$20k` TVL.

<div className="mediaWrapper">
  ![KPI lower bound and upper bound
  simulation](/images/kpi-bounds-simulation.png)
</div>

**Mechanism**: Rewards are only unlocked if the TVL exceeds the lower bound of
`$20k`. From there, the rewards are distributed linearly based on the KPI
achievement. If the pool reaches `$60k` in TVL, then `$6k` is distributed, but
if the TVL remains below `$20k`, no rewards are unlocked.

**Takeaway**: This structure protects projects from over-incentivizing in
situations where liquidity levels fall too low to be effective.

### Minimum payout with control limits

**Scenario**: Target KPI of `$100k` total value locked (TVL), with `$10k`
allocated as rewards, with a minimum payout percentage of `80%`, and `20%`
prorated between `$20k` and `$100k` TVL.

<div className="mediaWrapper">
  ![KPI minimum payout with control limits
  simulation](/images/kpi-minimum-payout-limits-simulation.png)
</div>

**Mechanism**: `80%` of the reward pool, so `$8k`, is distributed regardless of
KPI outcomes. The remaining `20%` is distributed based on the range between
`$20k` and `$100k` TVL. If the pool reaches `$75k` in TVL, LPs receive the `$8k`
minimum payout, plus a proportional part of the remaining `$2k`.

**Takeaway**: This structure balances baseline rewards with a dynamic incentive
that scales with performance.
