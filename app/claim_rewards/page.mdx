## Claim Rewards

The reward claiming process is designed to be straightforward, ensuring that users can claim their accrued rewards with minimal effort. The following steps describe the complete flow:

### 1. Initiating a Reward Claim

#### Access the Claims Dashboard
Navigate to the claims section of the platform (available on the top navigation bar). Here, all available rewards are displayed. Each reward is listed with the corresponding token and the total amount accrued.

#### Select Your Claim Option
- **Claim Reward:** For individual rewards, click the **Claim Reward** button located next to the respective token.
- **Claim All:** If a user has accumulated rewards for multiple tokens, the **Claim All** option allows them to claim all available rewards in one transaction, saving time and reducing gas fees.

### 2. Confirming the Transaction

#### Wallet Prompt
After clicking the claim button (either **Claim Reward** or **Claim All**), the user’s connected wallet (such as MetaMask or another supported wallet) will automatically open a transaction prompt.

#### Review Transaction Details
The prompt will display the details of the transaction, including:
- The total number of tokens to be claimed.
- Associated network fees.
- Confirmation of the token types involved.

#### Sign and Submit
Once the user verifies that all details are correct, they sign and submit the transaction through their wallet.

#### Reward Transfer
After a successful signature, the system automatically transfers the reward tokens to the user’s wallet.

### 4. Confirmation and Post-Claim Actions

#### On-Screen Confirmation
A confirmation message is displayed on the platform, notifying the user that the rewards have been successfully claimed.

#### Wallet Update
Users can check their wallet to verify that the reward tokens have been deposited.
