# Add Reward Ratio

Precision‑tune how incentives flow to liquidity providers—no custom contracts
required.

### What is Reward Ratio?

Reward Ratio is an optional toggle in the Metrom campaign builder that lets you
split emissions across **Token A**, **Token B**, and **Fees generated** instead
of paying every position the same flat APR.

### How it works under the hood

You're not locked into a 50/50 split. Pick exactly which behaviour you want to
incentivise by assigning a ratio to three separate inputs:

- **Token A** – rewards LPs for providing depth on the first asset

- **Token B** – rewards LPs for providing depth on the second asset

- **Fees** – rewards positions that are earning (i.e., in‑range, concentrated
  liquidity)

**Example:**

- A ratio of **Token A** - 0.3 | **Token B** - 0.3 | **Fees** - 0.4 means:

- 30 % of each epoch's rewards are distributed based on the amount of Token A in
  the position

- 30 % based on Token B

- 40 % based on fees earned

> **Note**: The Reward Ratio applies only to active, in-range liquidity—TVL that
> is out of range earns no rewards. Metrom automatically normalizes ratios if
> they do not sum exactly to 1.

### Enabling Reward Ratio

<div className="mediaWrapper">

</div>

1. **Create** a campaign → **Rewards tab**.
2. Toggle **Reward Ratio**.
3. **Enter percentages for the respective tokens**.

Example:

- **token A**: 30%
- **token B**: 30%
- **fees** : 40%

4. That’s it—no further action needed. You can now **enable KPI** or
   **Range-based incentives**, or skip ahead to the **Campaign Preview**.

### FAQs

#### Do ratios have to total 100 %?

Yes. If they don't, the UI warns you and Metrom normalises them before
committing on‑chain.

#### Does this work with Points campaigns?

Yes it does work with the Points campaign.

#### What if my pool has custom tokens?

Reward Ratio is agnostic to token types; simply map the sides you want to
incentivise.
