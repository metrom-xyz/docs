## useLeaderboard

Hook for retrieving the top 5 accounts that have received the most tokens or
points in a given campaign.

It's possible to also specify an address to ensure it appears in the
leaderboard, which is useful for displaying the rank of the currently connected
account.

### Import

```ts
import { useLeaderboard } from "@metrom-xyz/react";
```

### Usage

```tsx
import { useCampaign, useLeaderboard } from "@metrom-xyz/react";

function App() {
  const { loading: loadingCampaign, campaign } = useCampaign({
    chainId: 1,
    id: "0xa8b1dc25d4ea47406771c4db401455a5d8b377dff381e2aea2722084808b4b47",
  });

  const { loading: loadingLeaderboard, leaderboard } = useLeaderboard({
    campaign,
    address: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  });

  if (loadingCampaign || loadingLeaderboard) return <div>loading...</div>;

  if (!leaderboard) return <div>no distribution yet</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Last distribution: {leaderboard.timestamp}</p>
      <p>
        Your rank: #{leaderboard.connectedAccountRank.position}
        {leaderboard.connectedAccountRank.weight}
      </p>
      {leaderboard.sortedRanks.map((rank, i) => (
        <div key={rank.account}>
          <p>
            Rank: #{i + 1} {rank.weight}
          </p>
          {rank.distributed instanceof Array ? (
            <div>
              {/* Campaign with token rewards have an array of distributed tokens */}
            </div>
          ) : (
            <div>
              {/* Campaign with point rewards have a single distributed object */}
            </div>
