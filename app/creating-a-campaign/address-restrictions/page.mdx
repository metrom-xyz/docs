## Restrictions

When creating a campaign on Metrom you can choose to add `restrictions`, to
either `blacklist` addresses that shouldn't receive rewards, or `whitelist` only
those that should be eligible to receive rewards.

To enable restrictions, toggle the `FILTER ADDRESSES` option. Then, select the
type of restriction and add addresses either manually or by importing a CSV file
(the CSV must contain a single column listing the addresses). A maximum of 20
addresses can be restricted.

<div className="mediaWrapper">
    ![Empty restrictions](/images/creation-form-empty-restrictions.png)
</div>

For example, to block 20 addresses from receiving rewards, the configuration
will look like this:

<div className="mediaWrapper">
    ![Empty restrictions](/images/creation-form-configured-restrictions.png)
</div>
