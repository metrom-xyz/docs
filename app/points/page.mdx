## Incentivize with Points

Points campaign allow you to reward liquidity providers with points. This
feature is handy when you want to create incentives without immediate token
distribution or when you want to track participation for future rewards.

### How Points work

When you create a points campaign, instead of distributing tokens directly, you
assign points to liquidity providers based on their participation. These points
can be:

- Tracked on the Metrom dashboard
- Combined with other campaign features like KPIs or Range Based Incentives
- Distributed using the same mechanisms as token rewards

### Creating a Points campaign

1. Start creating a campaign as normal by selecting the DEX and pool.
2. Set the campaign duration.
3. In the **rewards section**, toggle to the "**Points**" (it is set to
   "**Tokens**" by default).
4. **Enter the number of points you want to distribute**.
5. **Choose a token to pay the campaign fee**.
6. That’s it—no further action is needed. You can now go ahead to the **Campaign Preview**.

**Note**: ***You cannot use KPI or Range-based incentives with points.*** 

### Use cases

Points campaigns are ideal for:

- Pre-launch incentives
- Community building
- Testing liquidity mining strategies
- Creating loyalty programs
- Governance participation tracking
