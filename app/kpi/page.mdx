## KPI based liquidity mining

Traditional farming distributes rewards throughout a campaign without defined
targets, often resulting in wasted rewards.

With KPI based liquidity mining, campaign creators can set custom TVL goals for
the community to reach to distribute the rewards accordingly.

In conventional business models, KPIs measure performance against specific

KPI-based farming.

This method maximizes capital efficiency by ensuring incentives are distributed
based on specific goals being met.
